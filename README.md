About:

For our senior design project we wanted to take aspects from cooking games
and visual novels to create a story driven game that follows the story of Margo as she 
begins her adventure to be the best cook in the universe.

How to play:

The game features various different mechanics, from dragging and dropping to stirring to even cutting between two points, for the player to experience using only their mouse.

Where to find everything:

The game is featured on Itch.IO (add link to game here)

Art can also be seen here (add link to artstation)
